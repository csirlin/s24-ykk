# Instructions

* Homework assignments will be done online in the Gradescope system: [{{ site.gradescope_url }}]({{ site.gradescope_url }}).
* Please pay close attention to the instructions, especially when asked to provide the answer
	* Many questions are autograded by the system, which does a character-by-character comparison of the correct answer and your submitted answer.
	* Please be **PRECISE** and **EXACT** in your solutions in this case, otherwise your answer will not be considered correct.
* For programming assignments, you may save your work at any time before the deadline (and I highly encourage this!). You may also resubmit your work any time before the deadline. We will only grade your latest submission.
