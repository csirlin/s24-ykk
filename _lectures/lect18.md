# Plan for today
- BST implementation


# Sample Final Exam

Use it as supplemental material, don't base your studying solely on the topics in this document:

As you can see, many of the questions are based on the in-class activities that we've done over the course of the quarter.

Final will be cumulative, so previous topics such as the Big-O and recursion are likely to show up on the exam as well.
