        *   supporting methods (`count()`, `pop()`, …)
        *   Understanding under-the-hood functionality of dictionaries vs lists
    *   List / string slicing `[:]`
    *   Strings
        *   supporting methods (`replace()`, `split()`, `find()`, …)
    *   Function definitions
    *   Control structures
        * `if, else, elif`
    * Loops
